# Valhalla - Inheritance

When you die, you might want to leave a message or a secret for your loved ones.
With this simple Go code, you can do that.

## How it works

1. Have a message client. I use Telegram as it is super easy.
2. Setup variables in the top
3. Compile and run on a server of your choice.

That's it
